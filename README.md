# README

Hi there! 

I'm Timothy Tolley and I'm a freelance software developer. This is my Github profile! 

While you're looking through bear in mind that anything labelled 'sprint' was part of my very early preparation for my programming bootcamp - Enspiral Dev Academy (EDA). In these repo's you will find anything from my learning how to push to Github to some basic practice with Algorithms. 

The rest of the repositories are a combination of my own personal projects from Timstales-React which is a full stack JavaScript Application to group projects that I have worked on both throughout my time at EDA and afterwards - 'Deltage' for example. 

If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to send me an email or make an issue on any of my repos!

Thanks for stopping by!

Timothy Tolley
